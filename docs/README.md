# ISR HPC Knowledge Base

Documentation for users of the HPC cluster of the **Institute for Systems and Robotics (ISR)**.

## Quick HPC introduction → [Overview](overview/README.md)

New to the cluster? Start with the [Overview](overview/README.md): which machine to log in to, how to run GPU jobs with SLURM, and where to keep your files, in one page with diagrams.

## Using the cluster → [User Guide](user-guide/README.md)

## Running jobs → [Slurm](slurm/README.md)

Eleven example jobs, from a one-line test to training on four GPUs, with the scripts to run them: [Slurm](slurm/README.md).

## Conventions used in these pages

- Commands are run as your normal user unless they start with `sudo`, which needs admin rights.
- Placeholders look like `<username>` or `<group>`. Replace them, including the angle brackets.
