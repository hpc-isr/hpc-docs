# Slurm

[← Home](../README.md)

Every job on the cluster goes through [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/): you say what your job needs (CPUs, memory, GPUs, time) and Slurm starts it on a node where those are free. This section collects what you need to run jobs, and eleven complete example jobs, from a one-line test to training on four GPUs across four nodes.

## Example jobs

Each example is a folder with its job scripts and a page explaining what it does, how to run it and what to expect. They go up in size, and each one introduces something new.

| # | Example | What it shows | Resources |
|---|---|---|---|

| 2 | [Parameter sweep on CPUs](examples/02-kalman-sweep/README.md) | Job arrays, a collector job with `afterok` (Kalman filter Monte Carlo) | 20 × 1 CPU |
| 3 | [Train a network on CPUs](examples/03-mnist-cpu/README.md) | Multi-threading with the cores you asked for (MNIST) | 16 CPUs |
| 4 | [Train a network on a GPU](examples/04-mnist-gpu/README.md) | A whole GPU, mixed precision, CPU vs GPU timing | 1 GPU |

| 8 | [3D scene from a video](examples/08-gaussian-splatting/README.md) | A CPU → GPU pipeline in Apptainer: COLMAP, then Gaussian Splatting | 16 CPUs, then 1 GPU |
| 9 | [Label images with a vision-language model](examples/09-vlm-captions/README.md) | Qwen3.8-27B on one GPU with vLLM, no cloud API | 1 GPU |
| 10 | [Training across several nodes](examples/10-ddp-multinode/README.md) | PyTorch DDP over two nodes with NCCL (ask an admin first) | 2 nodes × 1 GPU |
| 11 | [Robot learning on 4 GPUs](examples/11-isaaclab-4gpu/README.md) | Isaac Lab across 4 nodes: 16 384 humanoids on rough terrain (ask an admin first) | 4 nodes × 1 GPU |

> These examples are written for this cluster but **haven't all been run on it yet**. Timings and outputs on the example pages are estimates. If one fails, tell your group's admin (see [Who's who](../overview/contacts.md)) with the job ID and the log.

## Before you start

Get the examples into your home on `hpc01`:

    git clone https://github.com/hpc-isr/hpc-docs.git ~/hpc-docs
    cp -r ~/hpc-docs/docs/slurm/examples ~/slurm-examples
    cd ~/slurm-examples

Submit each example **from its own folder** (`cd ~/slurm-examples/03-mnist-cpu`, then `sbatch job.sbatch`): the scripts find their Python files through `$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR`, and their logs land there.

Each example that uses Python has its own environment, with only the packages it needs: numpy and matplotlib for the Kalman sweep, CPU-only PyTorch for MNIST on CPUs, and so on. Each one's packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` in its folder. Environments go on the node's local disk, in `/scratch/$USER/envs/<example>`: Python reads thousands of small files when it starts, and the local NVMe serves them much faster than your home on MooseFS.

`/scratch` isn't shared, so an environment exists only on the node where it was built. **You don't need to set anything up:** the first job of an example on a node creates its environment there, then later jobs on that node reuse it. That first job takes longer: seconds for numpy, 2–5 minutes for PyTorch, 15–30 minutes for Isaac Lab. Jobs that start together on one node wait for a single build. Each environment is rebuilt when its `requirements.txt` changes, and one nobody uses for 30 days is deleted with the rest of that node's old `/scratch` files. The shared code is in [`env.sh`](examples/env.sh). Examples 8 and 9 use Apptainer images instead.

To make sure your jobs land where the environment already exists, send them to one node with `--nodelist=hpc02`.

You don't need `--partition` or `--account`: Slurm sends each job to your group's node, the `shared` nodes or an idle node. If you are in more than one group, add `--account=<group>`. Every script sets `--time` and `--mem`; keep them close to what the job needs.

## Data and results

Every example follows the same pattern, which you should copy for your own jobs:

| What | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Code, job scripts | your home | The same on every node |
| Python environments | `/scratch/$USER/envs/<name>`, created on each node | Python starts much faster from the local disk. Each node needs its own copy, created in a job there |
| Datasets, model weights, download caches | `/scratch/$USER/datasets`, `/scratch/$USER/hf-cache`, ... | Downloaded once per node, reused by later jobs there. `/scratch` is the node's local NVMe disk, the fastest storage |
| The job's working files | `/scratch/$USER/<jobid>` | Fast, and doesn't load the shared filesystem. Removed when the job ends |
| Results to keep | `RESULTS_DIR`: `~/results/<example>` by default | Copied out when the job ends, even when it fails or runs out of time |

To keep results somewhere else, such as your group's NAS, set `RESULTS_DIR` when you submit:

    sbatch --export=ALL,RESULTS_DIR=/storage/anubis-nas/<group>/results/mnist job.sbatch

In a script, the pattern is:

    RESULTS_DIR="${RESULTS_DIR:-$HOME/results/my-job}"
    WORK="/scratch/$USER/$SLURM_JOB_ID"
    mkdir -p "$WORK/out"

    finish() {                      # runs however the job ends
        mkdir -p "$RESULTS_DIR/$SLURM_JOB_ID"
        cp -r "$WORK/out/." "$RESULTS_DIR/$SLURM_JOB_ID/"
        rm -rf "$WORK"
    }
    trap finish EXIT
    trap 'exit 143' TERM            # time limit or preemption: still run finish

    rsync -a "$HOME/data/my-dataset/" "$WORK/data/"       # stage the input
    srun python train.py --data "$WORK/data" --out "$WORK/out"

`/scratch` isn't shared: a file there is only visible on that node, and files untouched for 30 days are deleted. Long jobs that may restart on another node (examples 6, 7 and 11) also copy their checkpoints out every 30 minutes. More in [Storage](../user-guide/03-storage.md#scratch).

## Downloads and disk space

What each example downloads the first time, how long it takes to get ready, and the space it needs. Downloads into `/scratch` happen once per node, so a job that lands on a new node downloads again. Your quotas are 200 GiB soft in your home and 100 GiB soft in `/scratch` on each node (see [Storage](../user-guide/03-storage.md)).

| # | Downloads the first time | Size | Download time | Setup time (unpack, install, build) | Home | `/scratch` per node |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | nothing | | | | | |

| 4 | PyTorch with CUDA; MNIST | 3 GB + 60 MB | under 1 min | 2–5 min to create the environment | 5 MB of results | 7 GB environment, 0.1 GB dataset cache |

| 6 | Ultralytics with PyTorch; Pascal VOC, YOLO11n weights | 3 GB + 2.8 GB | under 1 min | 2–5 min to create the environment, 5–10 min to unzip and convert the labels | 0.1–0.5 GB per run | 7 GB environment, 4 GB dataset cache (7 GB while unpacking), plus the run while it trains |
| 7 | Isaac Lab, Isaac Sim 6.2, PyTorch (`setup.sbatch`); robot assets on the first run | 12 GB | about 1 min | 15–30 min to create the environment (`uv sync`) and 5–15 min of shader compilation, on each node's first run | a few GB of Isaac Sim caches, 0.1–1 GB per run | 25–30 GB checkout, environment and uv cache (hard-linked, so counted once), under 1 GB per run |
| 8 | nerfstudio image, sample scenes | 6.1 GB (5.4 + 0.7) | under 1 min | 10–20 min to build the `.sif` on each node's first run | 0.2–1 GB per scene | 5.5 GB image, 20 GB more while building it; 1–2 GB per job |
| 9 | vLLM image, Qwen3.8-27B-FP8 weights, COCO val2017 | 41 GB (9.2 + 30.9 + 0.8) | 1–3 min | 15–30 min to build the `.sif` on each node's first run; 2–5 min to load the model in every job | under 1 MB of captions | 9 GB image, 32 GB cache (weights + images); 35 GB more while building the image |
| 10 | PyTorch with CUDA; CIFAR-10, on each node | 3 GB + 170 MB | under 1 min | 2–5 min to create the environment, under 1 min to unpack | 50 MB of results | 7 GB environment, 0.4 GB dataset cache |
| 11 | nothing beyond example 7's, on each node | | | as example 7, on each node that doesn't have it yet | 0.1–1 GB per run | example 7's environment, under 1 GB per run |

The dataset and image sizes were measured from the registries and download servers in October 2026; the Python environment sizes are estimates. Download times assume the cluster's 10 Gbit/s internet link at 0.3–1 GB/s; a single download is often limited by the server it comes from. Setup times are estimates, and they grow when several people do it at once.

To free `/scratch` on a node, delete its caches in a job there, for example `srun --nodelist=hpc02 -t 5 rm -rf /scratch/$USER/hf-cache`. Deleting `/scratch/$USER/pip-cache` is always safe; an example's environment, `/scratch/$USER/envs/<example>`, is recreated by its next job there.
